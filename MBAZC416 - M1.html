Managerial economics 

Definition 

Managerial Economics: the 
application of economic theory and 
methods to business decision-making.

Business: Any situation where there is a 
transaction between two or more 
parties

Relationship with economic theory 

•Microeconomics
–Focuses on individual consumers and firms
–Theory of the firm
–Theory of consumer behaviour (demand)
–Production and cost theory (supply)
–Price theory
–Market structure and competition theory


•Macroeconomics
–Aggregate variables such as GDP, GNP, 
Unemployment, Inflation, etc.

Managerial Economics: How is it useful? 

•While economics attempts to describe how 
the economy works, managerial economics 
speaks to how the economy shouldwork!
•It prescribesrules for improving managerial 
decisions
•It helps managers recognize how economic 
forces affect organizations 
•It links economic concepts with quantitative 
methods to develop vital tools for managerial 
decision making 

Managerial Economics: a Tool for 
Improving Management Decision Making

What is the best “choice”

•Understand the economic environment in which firms operate
–We will be exploring several case studies throughout the course


•Consider alternatives
•Make optimal choices to maximize 
.Profit 
.Market share 
.Managerial interests
.Government influence
.National interests
.Social and environmental benefits

Summary

•Managerial Economics helps business leaders and policy 
makers to make optimal decisions
•Leverages economic analysis for concepts such as 
demand, cost, production, profit and competition
•Bridges the gap between theory and practice
•Provides tool sets to make optimal decisions

Application of concepts using Case Studies

•Multinational production and pricing
–How does Ford or GM decide where to produce its cars 
(multinational factory locations) and where to sell 
(multinational markets)


•Market Entry
–How do major bookstores decide where to set up shop, 
assess demand and profitability, assess and react to 
threats from online stores


•R & D Decisions
–How does a pharma company decide whether to invest 
in traditional biochemistry based research or to pursue 
biogenetic approaches (such as gene splicing)

Positive and Normative economics

•This is also referred to as is/ought 
distinction 
•Positive statements
–Factual statements 
–It can be verified by empirical study or logic


•Normative statements
–Value judgements
–It can’t be verified by empirical study or logic


•Relevance of the distinction to the study of 
managerial economics

Opportunity costs

•Scarcity and choice are central to the 
economics discipline
•In the face of scarcity, we make many 
decisions 
•Follow one course of action and forgo some 
other course of action


Opportunity cost is the highest valued 
alternative forgone whenever a choice is 
made

Definitions of Profit

•Business or Accounting Profit:Total revenue minus the 
explicit or accounting costs of production.
•Economic Profit:Total revenue minus the explicit andimplicit costs of production.
•Opportunity Cost:Implicit value of a resource in its best 
alternative use.

Theories of Profit

•Risk-Bearing Theories of Profit
•Frictional Theory of Profit
•Monopoly Theory of Profit
•Innovation Theory of Profit
•Managerial Efficiency Theory of Profit

Social Function of Profit

•Profit is a signal that guides the allocation of society’s 
resources.
•High profits in an industry are a signal that buyers want 
more of what the industry produces.
•Low (or negative) profits in an industry are a signal that 
buyers want less of what the industry produces.

Ten Economic Principles for 
managers 

1.Making optimal decisions
2.Decisions are always among alternatives
3.Decision alternatives always have costs and benefits
4.Objective is to increase the firm’s value
5.Firm’s value is measured by its expected profit 
6.Firm’s sales revenue depends on demand for its product
7.The firm must minimize cost for each level of output
8.The firm must develop a strategy consistent with its market
9.Growth depends on rational investment decisions
10.Firms deal rationally and ethically with laws and regulations

1. Making decisions

•The role of the managers is to make 
decisions
–Business firms come in all sizes
–No firm has unlimited resources
–Short-run and long-run decisions


•Managerial Economics: How to make 
decisions that make sense for the 
operation of the firm



BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

2. Decisions are among alternatives 

•Choices are always among alternatives 
•Example-buying a new computer
•A job can be done by many, but some may 
be better at it than others-cost differs



BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

3. Decision alternatives have costs and benefits

•Working Vs. Pursuing further studies
•What we consider when making our decisions? 
•Benefits: benefit gained from studying –enhanced knowledge 
and capabilities, which lead to better career opportunities in 
the future
•Cost -cost of giving up short term promotions and increments
•Choosing to study-additional benefit gained from further 
studies exceeds the additional cost
•Opportunity cost

4. Objective of management is to 
increase the firm’s value

•Profit is the difference between TR and TC
•Different types of organizations/ firms
•Problem -Managers attempt to maximize own interest 
while shareholders increase own benefit 
•Principal –agent problem 



BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

5. The firm’s value is measured by 
its expected profit 

•Example: consider two companies using different 
production process
•Which one would be the better company?
•This can be easily evaluated based on excepted profits
•Present value of the expected future profit stream 



BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

6. Firm’s sales revenue depends on 
demand for its product 

•Some goods are highly price sensitive while other goods 
are less price sensitive
•Demand for a product is a function of a number of factors 
in addition to price



BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

7. Firm must minimize cost for each 
level of output 

•TR -TC
•Important factors:
–Technology of production 
–Input prices 
–Factors of production 
–Different levels of technologies





BITS Pilani, Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956

8. Firm must develop a strategy consistent 
with its market

•We will study the various market structures and the 
appropriate strategy for each of these situations
•Selling identical products
•Differentiated products
•Example -airline industry, software industry, etc.



Value of the Firm

The present value of all expected future profits

9. Firm’s growth depends on 
rational investment 

•Decision to invest in new plant or equipment or develop a 
new product 
•The process of evaluating new investments of the firm-
capital project analysis or capital budgetting
•Capital project -calculating the expected stream of 
benefits it will produce for the firm

10. Successful firms deal rationally and 
ethically with laws and regulations 

•Various business lawsand regulations 
•Case of Enron or closer hope the collapse of Satyam 
highlight the consequences of unethical behaviour

Expectations

•Replay prerecorded digital content before class
•Attend all “live” classes else replay recordings
•Review the relevant chapters from textbook before and after 
class
•Do the homework and assignments in a timely manner
•Make sure you have access to laptop/ computer with Excel; 
we will need it for experiential learning components in 
subsequent classes. (Excel 2007 or later versions preferred.)
